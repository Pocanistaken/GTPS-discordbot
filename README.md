Basic Usage
DiSky is here to help Bot management with Skript. First, you must know basics of both Skript and Discord Bot system.

No help will be given if you are asking for basic features!

Loading
After creating your bot, create a new script file and enter the default login code:

on load:
	make new bot:
		enable all default intents
		login to "TOKEN" with name "NAME"
		set online status of bot "NAME" to do not disturb # > Or either online, idle, offline
		set presence of bot "NAME" to watching "the beautiful DiSky v3 >:D" # > Or check for futher presence on the docs
Creating Discord Command
Discord command are made via DiSky and are fired when anyone types a specific message. DiSky will by itself parse every argument and execute the given code.

discord command whois <member>:
	prefixes: !
	trigger:
		make embed:
			set author of embed to "Who is %arg-1% ?"
			set author icon of embed to avatar of event-guild
			add "`•` __Name:__ %arg-1%" to {_l::*}
			add "`•` __Nickname:__ %discord nick name of arg-1%" to {_l::*}
			add "`•` __Discord ID:__ %id of arg-1%" to {_l::*}
			add "`•` __Avatar URL:__ [Click!](%avatar of arg-1%)" to {_l::*}
			set {_b::*} to badges of arg-1
			if {_b::*} is not set:
				set {_b::*} to "None"
			add "`•` __Badges:__ %{_b::*}%" to {_l::*}
			add "`•` __Creation date__ %create date of arg-1%" to {_l::*}
			add "`•` __Join date__ %join date of arg-1%" to {_l::*}
			set description of embed to join {_l::*} with nl
			set color of embed to orange
			set thumbnail of embed to avatar of arg-1
		reply with last embed
Creating Slash Command
Slash command are considered as interaction, and DiSky will by itself register them globally or per guilds:

# > Slash command now works like discord command, and DiSky manage itself the registring on Discord.

# > If you only specify guilds (IDs or names), DiSky will register slash commands in these guilds (no wait cooldown)
# > If you only specify bots (names), DiSky will register slash commands in the bot (globally) and will take up to an hour to be updated.

# > Possible argument are from the slash command types, not discord command arguments.
# > You can use:
# -> string
# -> integer
# -> boolean
# -> user
# -> channel
# -> role
# -> number

slash command ban <user> [<string>] [<boolean>]:

   # > This new feature regroup options needed for arguments.
   # > They are from first to last, aka 1 represent "user", 2 represent "string" in our case.
   # > You can specify:
   # REQUIRE -> 'name', the argument name without space allowed.
   # REQUIRE -> 'description', the argument description with space allowed
   # OPTIONAL -> 'default values', list of values, only working for STRING & INTEGER option, to show to the user.
   options:
   	1:
   		name: target
   		description: The target user
   	2:
   		name: reason
   		description: The reason of banning
   		# > Default values will be presented with a name and, of course, a value.
   		# > They ONLY WORK with STRING and INTEGER.
   		# > The name represent the default value name shown to the user on the argument selection.
   		# > The value represent the value that will get the argument expression in the command (arg 2 here)
   		default values:
   			1:
   				name: Spamming
   				value: Banned for spamming in channels
   			2:
   				name: Hacking
   				value: Banned for hacking some one / the server (tried)

   # > The slash command description show in the Discord "/" menu.

   trigger:
   	
   	# > There's no member as argument (fuck discord), we have to parse ourselves the member in event-guild.
   	retrieve member with id discord id of event-user and store it in {_event-member}
   	retrieve member with id discord id of arg 1 and store it in {_target-member}
   	
   	# > Should never happen if the command is executed in a guild, but in case of anything x)
   	{_event-member} is set
   	{_target-member} is set

   	if {_event-member} don't have discord permission administrator:
   		reply with hidden ":x: **Oh no, you don't have the permission to do that :(**"
   		stop
